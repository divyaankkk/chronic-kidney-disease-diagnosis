Overview:
This repository contains Python code for diagnosing Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using machine learning techniques. The project focuses on comparing various decision tree-based learning algorithms for accuracy in CKD diagnosis.

Project Description:
Chronic Kidney Disease is a progressive deterioration of kidney function, demanding early detection and treatment. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify whether a person has CKD or not. It evaluates the performance of decision tree-based algorithms and compares their accuracies.

Requirements:

Python 3.x

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm
